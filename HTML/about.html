            <p class="lead">Baldrake Surefoot was an oddity amongst the dwarves of Svartalfheim. Rather then be content amongst the subterranean holds of his realm or the forges of his forefarthers who chose to wander and explore the craggy landscapes of its surface. Resources were sparse up top, so Bladrake had to be creative in preparing anything he could find to eat and survive, whether it be the tought hide of a Buggane mole or the crispy wings of the bloodthirsty Camazotz bat. 
            But the wastes of Svartalfheim's surface only seemed to go on forever. Yet when Baldrake began to contemplate returning to the underground labyrinths of his people he tripped over something that could not have possibly been there. A single root, sticking out of the ground. Curious, he pulled at that root, only to have a full tree sprout from the spot and with that tree a an opening with light poured out from it. On that day Baldrake had discovered that which was only
            whispered about in legends, a branch from the world tree Yggdrasil. On that day Baldrake's true adventure had begun, as he used the new found portal to journey across all the nine realms treating with such beings as the elves of Alfheim or the frost giants of Jotunheim. Along the way he experienced and experimented with cusine from each othe worlds, and upon retiring his explorer's career decided to open up a restaurant here at the gateway of Midgard in order to allow
            others share some of those same experiences traveling across Yggdrasil that he had been blessed with. Today, only Baldrake Surefoot can boast of having the first trans-realm restaurant, to the satisfactiona and gratitude of denizins from across all the nine worlds.</p>
